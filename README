2. Purpose----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The purpose of this program is to calculate flow statistics from a given 
   capture file. Flowtbag was designed with offline processing as the primary
   focus.

3. Requirements-----------------------------------------------------------------

   Currently, Flowtbag requires only that you have a system with libpcap.

4. Usage------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The program's usage is currently left undocumented due to the rapidly
   changing functionality of the program in its early stages. However, if you
   run flowtbag, the currently implemented options should be displayed. A
   typical use case might look something like:

      $ ./flowtbag test.cap > test.out

4. Output-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Flowtbag currently has two seperate channels for output. To stdout, a stream
   of comma seperated values is output. Line by line, these represent the flows
   in the capture. The features output are given, in order, in section 4.1. The
   second output channel is stderr. This is where reports, as well as any
   debugging information is displayed. This allows the user to redirect output
   to a text file, and still receive updates as the program runs. The setup for
   output is likely to change in future versions of Flowtbag when a better
   system is designed.
